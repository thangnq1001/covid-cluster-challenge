## Summary

The problem was hard and the deadline was tight for me to build a complete, production-level app with front end, back end and database.
That's why I decided to build a front-end-only app. I was aware that without back end and database, the scalability of the app would be bad. Sorry for that.

I focused on correctness of the 3 functions in the coding challenge.
The solutions or algorithms I used in the app might be bad though. Hope I will learn something from this challenge.

I built a hex grid for visualizing/coordinating objects, and a UI for finding neighbors, adding hexagon and removing hexagon.

I used Breadth First Search to validate before removing a hexagon.

The data is persisted on the local storage of browser.
